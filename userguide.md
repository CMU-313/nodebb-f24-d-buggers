## Installation & Launch NodeBB Instance Locally
To install the project and the new features, follow these steps:

    git clone https://github.com/CMU-313/nodebb-frontend-f24-d-buggers.git
    ```

     ```bash
    redis-server
    ```
3. In another terminal, navigate to the root directory of the repository:
    ```bash

    ```
4. Set up NodeBB (all answers should be default except for database - redis):
